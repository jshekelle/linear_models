```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

set.seed(1)

```


```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  rename(boro = neighbourhood_group,
         neighborhood = neighbourhood) %>% 
  filter(boro != "Staten Island") %>% 
  select(price, stars, boro, neighborhood, room_type)
```


Fit a model for price as the outcome

```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ stars + boro, data = nyc_airbnb)
```

```{r}
summary(fit)
```


```{r}
fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(term = str_replace(term, "^boro", "Boro: ")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```



Be careful with factors...

```{r}
nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(boro = fct_infreq(boro),
         room_type = fct_infreq(room_type))

fit = lm(price ~ stars + boro, data = nyc_airbnb)

fit %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```


```{r}

```
